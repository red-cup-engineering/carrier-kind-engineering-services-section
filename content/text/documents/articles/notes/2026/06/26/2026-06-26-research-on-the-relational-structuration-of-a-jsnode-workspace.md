## Thesis

A pnpm workspace is not *like* the corpus's structures; it already *is* an instance of them.
The agency spiral (module → package → workspace → super-repo), the Belnap four-corner charge (unresolved / built / failing / conflicting), the ≤ₖ knowledge order (the dependency DAG), the coordination cohomology Ȟ¹ (version skew and cycles), the Lorentzian causal order (build order), the regimes (build vs. watch), the present⊣free adjunction (lockfile vs. `node_modules`), and the InfoTile (the content-addressed store) — each is realized, concretely, by a structure already sitting in the repo. **JS-metacircularity is therefore recognition, not invention:** we are not designing structures, we are admitting structures the host already holds and naming the faculty arrow each one is a shadow of.
What we must *build* is the single host-admission boundary that reads these structures into structures, plus the pure arrows over them — and that inventory is the purpose of this note.

The discipline is fixed by [the IR/polyglot handoff](../../../../../../../../../../../public-services-section/services/personal-services-section/services/emsenn-services-section/content/text/documents/articles/notes/2026/06/22/2026-06-22-research-on-the-ir-term-layer-and-the-polyglot-future.md): metacircularity is a **tower with a grounded floor, never a loop** (Gödel forbids self-certification).
For the *logic* the floor is Lean's LCF kernel; for the *substrate* the floor is the JS/Node host, touched at exactly one **admission boundary** (the arrow/boundary gate classes "read `package.json`/`fs`" as admission: raw → structure, exempt from being a morphism).
Keep that touch single-sourced and the structures below are pure arrows; smear it and the tower folds to a loop.

## I. The objects (structures), scale by scale

The workspace is the agency spiral instantiated in code.
Each scale is the same quartet, lifted along a sheaf of the scale below.

### Scale 0 — the module (the meme)

An **ESM module** (`*.mts`) is the atomic structure — a `relating` meme.
Its boundary is two sets of edges: **imports** (in-edges, what crosses *into* it) and **exports** (out-edges, its public surface).
The module graph within a package is a finite directed graph; ESM forbids true initialization cycles, so it is acyclic at the value layer (a real obstruction lives in the *type* layer, see §II).
Structure: `ModuleStructure { specifier, imports[], exports[] }`.

### Scale 1 — the package (the agent)

A **package** binds its modules into an agent, and `package.json` is its **membrane** — its settled, "settled-below-open-above" self-description.
The four faces are already present:

- **communicating (across):** the `exports` map — the package's public surface, the utterance it makes across its boundary.
  Each subpath (`.
  `, `./service`, `./writing`) is a *projector*; the `exports` map is the capability vocabulary (the CLAUDE.md "capability surface").
- **knowing (inside):** the internal module graph — the package's reflection of its own structure; the `.d.mts` type surface is its interior schema.
- **playing (outside):** the `bin` map — invocable strategies, the out-face *cut = invocation*.
  A bin is a computing strategy boundary.
- **animating (binds):** the **build** (`tsc`: `src/*.mts` → `dist/*.mjs` + `*.d.mts`) — the package's perceive→act loop that produces its dist from its source.

Structure: `ManifestStructure` (name, version, `type:"module"`, `exports`, `bin`, `dependencies`, `devDependencies`, `scripts`, `engines`, `files`, `sideEffects`).
The version + `exports` are the *settled* boundary; `devDependencies` are the Simondon **associated milieu** (residual potential the package carries but does not expose).

### Scale 2 — the workspace (the organization)

A **pnpm workspace** binds packages into an organization.
`pnpm-workspace.yaml` is the membership site (a set of globs → the package set); the **lockfile** is the *institution* — the settled, content-addressed order the workspace *is*.
The off-diagonal faces:

- **socializing (across):** the shared dependency *protocol* — `workspace:*` conventions, the common version field, the agreed registry.
  The semiosphere of the package society.
- **computing (inside):** the build *across* packages — distributed, repeatable cognition; the topological-sort settling; bins-as-computing-strategies; type-checking.
- **gaming (outside):** the *concurrent* build / test matrix — many packages built in parallel (a concurrent game with a real schedule; weaker reading, flagged).
- **organizing (binds):** `pnpm-workspace.yaml` + lockfile + the dependency DAG — the agency descent of the package society (its governance/operations).

The dependency graph is the **off-diagonal cover**: packages over their shared dependencies.
This is where the genuine obstruction lives (§II), exactly as the spiral predicts — the diagonal (one package's own modules) glues coordination-free; the off-diagonal (distinct packages over shared deps) can contest.

### Scale 3 — the super-repo (the federation)

A **super-repo of workspaces** (561-group with its `content/`, `relmath`, lab submodules) is the next spiral turn: a federation of organizations.
Submodules and a meta-lockfile are the `federate` (‖) of constituent workspaces.
Per the spiral note, the genuinely scale-3 obstruction is degree-2 (the Ȟ² of a cover-of-covers); the practical shadow is the cross-workspace version/coordination cost no single workspace can see.

## II. The cross-cutting relational readings (the deep part)

Each reading below is tied to a concrete workspace structure.
Identifications marked **iso** are genuine; those marked **analogy** are provisional and want a test before belief.

- **≤ₖ (knowledge order) = the dependency DAG (iso).** `a depends-on b` means `a` knows `b`; the build accumulates knowledge monotonically (deps before dependents).
  The topological sort *is* the ≤ₖ-monotone settling order.
  CALM/coordination-freedom = a clean DAG.

- **Charge / Belnap FOUR = resolution state (iso, and the sharpest one).** A package/cell is **⊥** (unresolved/unbuilt), **t** (built + passing), **f** (failing), **⊤** (conflicting — two dependents demand incompatible versions). pnpm's signature behavior — *nest the conflicting versions rather than fail* — is **paraconsistent ⊤-retention**: it holds both witnesses instead of exploding.
  Version conflicts are literally the held-contradiction charge, and pnpm is a ⊤-tolerant resolver.
  (npm's flatten-or-fail is the ⊤→f collapse.)

- **Ȟ¹ (coordination cohomology) = the version/cycle obstruction (iso).** The cover nerve is packages over shared dependencies; **Ȟ¹ = 0 ⟺ the nerve is a forest** = no diamond-conflict requiring a coordinated version pin.
  Dependency *cycles* are the degree-1 obstruction the build cannot settle through (pnpm forbids them → the build is well-defined exactly when Ȟ¹ vanishes).
  Phantom deps and version skew are the contested cells.
  This is the corpus's `federate-graded` decomposition (shared / contested / needs-coordination) applied to the package society.

- **Lorentzian causal order = build order (iso).** `a depends-on b ⟹ b ≺ a` (b in a's past light cone).
  The build is a settling that respects the causal order; an **incremental build recomputes exactly the future light cone of a change.** The `LightObservation` reading of a workspace is its build-order causal set; "kernel A in kernel B's light cone" is "B transitively depends on A."

- **Regime = build mode (iso/analogy).** A one-shot build is **strict-finite** (terminates with a normal form = dist).
  A **watch/dev** build is **Scott** (converges in the limit, monotone partials, eventually-consistent).
  Dependency resolution is a settling to the lockfile fixed-point.
  A never-settling dev loop over a live agent is the aperiodic cap.

- **present ⊣ free = lockfile ⊣ `node_modules` (iso, load-bearing).** `present` (forgetful) = the lockfile + manifests (generators: names, versions, ranges, integrity).
  `free` (materialize) = `pnpm install` rebuilding the full symlink farm. **`free ∘ present ≅ id`** is exactly *reproducible install*: the lockfile fully determines `node_modules`.
  The corpus's "structures store only their generators" is pnpm's content-addressed store made concrete — the workspace already obeys "no free data."

- **InfoTile = the content-addressed store (iso).** Each package@version is stored once by integrity hash; the hash is its `$id` / causal coordinate; the resolved workspace state is a bilattice-coloured tiling of packages keyed by resolution.
  The lockfile is the InfoTile's presented form; the diffraction/spectral invariant is the workspace's structural fingerprint (two workspaces with the same lock-diffraction are install-indistinguishable — homometry).

## III. The faculty mapping (which faculty owns which arrow)

| workspace structure | structure | faculty arrow |
|---|---|---|
| module import/export graph | `ModuleStructure` | `relating` (substrate) + `knowing` (interior reflection) |
| `exports` map (public surface) | `ExportSurface` | `communicating` (the package's utterance across its boundary) |
| `bin` map (executables) | `BinSurface` | `playing` (cut = invocation) → `computing` (bins as strategies) |
| `scripts` | `ScriptGraph` | `playing`/`gaming` (named plays; the concurrent script DAG) |
| build `src → dist` | `BuildDerivation` | `animating` (perceive→act loop); `computing` (the settling) |
| dependency DAG | `DependencyGraph` | `organizing` (the off-diagonal cover; its Ȟ¹) |
| `pnpm-workspace.yaml` + lockfile | `WorkspaceStructure`/`Resolution` | `organizing` (the institution); `socializing` (the dep protocol) |
| `.d.mts` type structure | `TypeGraph` | `knowing` (schema/predication); `computing` (type-checking) |
| content-addressed store | `StoreTile` | `relating/writing` (the InfoTile codec) |
| super-repo / submodules | `Federation` | `organizing.federate` (‖); scale-3 |

The metacircular core is **computing** (bins-as-strategies + type-flow) and **organizing** (the package society + its Ȟ¹), with **relating/writing** holding the codecs (manifest ↔ wire, graph ↔ svg/mermaid/uml).
This is the *substrate* face of the same self-reflection whose *operational* face is the IR (`eval = settling`) and whose *semantic* face is computing's LSP/DAP: three mirrors of the engine on itself.

## IV. The single admission boundary (the "JS Mark")

Exactly one module touches the host: it reads `package.json`, `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, the `.mts`/`.d.mts` files, and the ESM resolver, and emits the raw structures above.
By the arrow/boundary gate this is **admission** (raw → structure), exempt from being a morphism.
Everything else — dependency-graph construction, topological sort, Ȟ¹, build-order derivation, charge classification, type-flow — is a **pure arrow over admitted structures** (an IR-expressible morphism, structure domain *and* codomain).
Serving the catalog/diagram is a **transport** boundary.
So the workspace decomposes cleanly into:

```
host (floor) ──admission──▶ structures ──pure arrows (faculty mirrors)──▶ structures ──transport──▶ wire
```

The build is the only place trust enters; keeping it one module is what makes this a tower.

## V. What is JS-specific vs. language-neutral (the polyglot seam)

Per §7 of the IR/polyglot note, the structure *shapes* are the contract; the admission boundary is per-host.
The neutral shapes and their host realizations:

| neutral structure | JS/Node/pnpm | Rust/Cargo | Guile/Guix |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ManifestStructure` | `package.json` | `Cargo.toml` | package recipe |
| `WorkspaceStructure` | `pnpm-workspace.yaml` | `[workspace]` | manifest/channel |
| `DependencyGraph` | `workspace:*`/semver | crate graph | propagated-inputs |
| `Resolution` (present) | `pnpm-lock.yaml` | `Cargo.lock` | `guix.lock`/profile |
| `StoreTile` (InfoTile) | pnpm content store | `~/.cargo` | `/gnu/store` (← the original!) |
| `BinSurface` | `bin` | `[[bin]]` | `bin/` outputs |
| `ExportSurface` | `exports` | `pub` + crate API | module exports |
| `BuildDerivation` | `tsc` | `cargo build` | the derivation |

The faculty mirrors consume the neutral structures, so adding Rust is "write one Cargo admission boundary," not a rewrite.
Guix is notable: `/gnu/store` is literally the content-addressed InfoTile/Nix-as-settling store the corpus already names — Guile metacircularity inherits the store reading for free.

## VI. What we need to build

1. **The JS admission fiber (the Mark).** One host-touching module: manifests + workspace + lockfile + module/type files + resolver → the raw structures.
  The single free-data admitter.
2. **The structures** (TypeBox, schema-first, single-sourced): `ModuleStructure`, `ManifestStructure`, `ExportSurface`, `BinSurface`, `ScriptGraph`, `DependencyGraph`, `TypeGraph`, `WorkspaceStructure`, `Resolution`, `StoreTile`, `BuildDerivation`, `Federation`.
3. **The pure arrows, placed in their owning faculties:** dependency-DAG construction + topological sort + Ȟ¹ (organizing); build-order causal set (organizing/Lorentzian); charge classification incl. ⊤-conflict (computing/socializing); bins-as-strategies + type-flow (computing); module-graph reflection (knowing); manifest/graph codecs (relating/writing).
4. **The metacircular fixpoint test (the proof we got it):** `computing` reads `lib/computing`'s own `package.json` + bins through the mirror and recovers its own action surface — golden-vectored, the §5 discipline.
  Closes the JS loop *as a tower*: host → admission → structures → computing's self-image.
5. **The transport mount stays in `apps/jsnode-ick`** — a served configuration over the faculty mirrors, not the reflection itself.

## Open questions

- **The ≤ₜ (truth) axis of a workspace.** ≤ₖ is the dep order; what is the orthogonal truth lean?
  Candidate: type-soundness / conformance status (does it typecheck + pass) as the ≤ₜ-graded charge, making (build-state × type-state) the full Belnap bilattice on a package.
- **Is the parallel build genuinely `gaming` (FSym concurrent game) or merely a schedule?** Test: does it carry a real symmetry / name-mobility, or is it just topological-sort parallelism?
  (Flagged analogy above.)
- **Scale-3 degree-2 obstruction in the super-repo.** Does the cross-submodule version cover exhibit a non-trivial Ȟ²?
  That is the discriminator for "federation vs. bigger workspace," and the workspace is the most concrete place to first compute it.
- **Type-layer cycles.** Value-layer ESM is acyclic, but `import type` cycles are tolerated — these are the workspace's own ⊤/contested cells at the type tier; worth a dedicated reading.

## Provenance

The agency-spiral and present⊣free framings are corpus-grounded (the spiral and IR/polyglot notes); the per-structure identifications (charge = resolution state, Ȟ¹ = version/cycle obstruction, causal order = build order, present⊣free = lockfile ⊣ `node_modules`, InfoTile = content store) are this note's synthesis — checkable claims, to be confirmed as the structures and arrows are built and golden-vectored, not settled citations.
The `iso`/`analogy` marks are the honest confidence flags.
